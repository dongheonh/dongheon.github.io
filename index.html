                    <h3>An Enhanced Sensing Methods for Soft Robot</h3>
                    <p>
                        This study presents a proprioceptive method for soft robot shape estimation, integrating IMUs and bend sensors with a Kalman filter to reduce drift and enhance accuracy. A piecewise constant curvature model and machine learning address nonlinearities, achieving a 4.54% error relative to robot length, outperforming similar methods.

                    <h3>Proprioception Based on Shape-Morphing Structural Strain Sensors</h3>
                    <p>
                        A novel shape-morphing strain sensing structure improves proprioception versatility and wearability with high reliability and accuracy. Key takeaways include using quasi-static principles and optimization for 3D configuration estimation, SVD-based modeling for precise deformation mapping, and a reusable, modular design for diverse robotic applications.

                    <h3>Shape Morphing Control for Soft Gripper</h3>
                    <p>
                        This study presents an embedded shape-morphing system for grippers, using pneumatic kirigami-inspired actuators to adapt to object size and weight. Simulated with a discrete elastic rod model, the system integrates stress and bend sensors for shape estimation and pneumatic control for stable object handling.

                    <h3>Control of a Biologically-Inspired Humanoid Robot Neck Utilizing a Stewart Platform</h3>
                    <p>
                        This study introduces a 6-DOF parallel Stewart platform for a humanoid robot neck, enabling human-like yaw, pitch, and roll motions. Using linear actuators and an IMU-based control system, precise and user-directed movements were achieved. Identified issues, including joint friction and circuit instability, were addressed with proposed solutions. This work advances lifelike humanoid neck mechanisms for enhanced interaction and agility.

                    <h3>Implementation and Development of a Tractor’s Path Tracking Algorithm Based on Dynamic Target Control</h3>
                    <p>
                        This study presents a Dynamic Path Tracking Algorithm for autonomous tractors that eliminates pre-generated reference paths. Unlike the Pure Pursuit Algorithm, it dynamically adjusts target distances based on head and distance errors, accounting for steering and speed delays. Experiments with R-type and C-type turns demonstrate comparable accuracy to the Pure Pursuit Algorithm, providing an efficient and flexible solution.
